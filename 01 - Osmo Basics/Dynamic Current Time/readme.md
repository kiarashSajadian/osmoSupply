Implementation
Default
When no timezone is added to the [data-current-time] data attribute it will get the timezone defined in the script, as defaut: Europe/Amsterdam

Adding Timezone
You can add a timezone by hand by passing it in the [data-current-time="Europe/Amsterdam"] attribute

Show less information
It's possible to remove the seconds or timezone dindication. The script will still work fine.

List with timezones
You can find a full list with timezone (TZ Identifier) options on Wikipedia
